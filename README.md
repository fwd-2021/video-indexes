# Video Indexes

Visit [the home page for the video index wiki](wiki).

## How to Contribute

1. If a week hasnâ€™t been added yet in the wiki, add it. All you need to do is edit the wiki home
   page and prepare a link to the new week in the same style as the others there, something like
   `[Week Eight](week-08)`.
2. On the actual week page, include the dates for each class that week, in the format of something
   like `October 7, 2021`.
3. Below the date, include the link to the YouTube video for that date. Check the YouTube playlist,
   which is also linked to from the wiki home page.
4. Add the first time marker, if it doesn't exist. `00:00:00 Introductory chit-chat` should be the
   first one.
5. Add remaining time markers with an `HH:MM:SS` (hours minutes seconds) timestamp, including
   leading zeroes: `01:01:01`, for example, for something significant at one hour, one minute, and
   one second into the video.
6. Write your marker as a noun phrase: *Styling buttons in CSS* or *Validating HTML with the W3C*,
   and so on.
7. Save the wiki page. (Hint: do this often, so you don't lose work or have a collision with
   another student editing at the same time.)

**Be sure that you're editing the wiki using your GitHub account that you're using for class.**
Stolley will award participation credit and update the YouTube videos regularly, but your username
has to match.
